# UN_Sustainable_Development_Goals_Sustainability

#### This project analyzes the data related to the United Nation's Global Sustainable Development Goal 12: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns," in order to visualize trends and predict if the targets will be met by the goal target's deadlines of 2020 and 2030.

Imported xlsx files and information on Goal 12 are from the UN's SDG database website: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database with a total of 375,264 data observations related to the sustainability goal.  However, due to incomplete data from some of the target datasets, the data analysis for machine learning focuses primarily on Target 12.2 and Target 12.4, although the locally-hosted website under the "website" folder provides data insights for all of goal's targets.
