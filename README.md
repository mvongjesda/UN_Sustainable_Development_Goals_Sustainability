# UN_Sustainable_Development_Goals_Sustainability



#### This project analyzes the data related to the United Nation's Global Sustainable Development Goal 12: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns," in order to visualize trends and predict if the targets will be met by the goal target's deadlines of 2020 and 2030.


##### Goal and targets are as follows:

##### GOAL 12:  
  Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

###### TARGET 12.1:  
  Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with    developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries
###### TARGET 12.2:  
  By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
###### TARGET 12.3:  
  By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses
###### TARGET 12.4:  
  By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment
###### TARGET 12.c:  
  Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities
###### TARGET 12.b  
  Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products


Imported xlsx files and information on goal 12 are from the UN's SDG database website: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database with a total of 375,264 data observations related to the sustainability goal.  However, due to incomplete data from some of the target datasets, we will be focus on the data from Target 12.2 and Target 12.4.
