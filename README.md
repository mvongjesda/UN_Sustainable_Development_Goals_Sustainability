# UN_Sustainable_Development_Goals_Sustainability  

### This project analyzes the data related to the United Nation's Global Sustainable Development Goal 12: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns," in order to visualize trends and predict if the targets will be met by the goal target's deadlines of 2020 and 2030.

Imported xlsx files (found under the "resources/data" folder), images, and information on Goal 12 are from the [UN's SDG database website](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database) with a total of 375,264 data observations related to the sustainability goal.  The data was then cleaned and processed, and the findings and visualizations are hosted on the created project website.
  
The [project website](https://mvongjesda.github.io/UN_Sustainable_Development_Goals_Sustainability/SDGoals_UN/landing.html) provides data insights with Tableau graphs for all each of the the Goal 12 targets. However, due to incomplete data from some of the target datasets, the data analysis in jupyter notebook utilizing python, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn for machine learning focuses primarily on Target 12.2 and Target 12.4.  The HTML/css/bootstrap website files can be found under the "SDGoals_UN" folder and the landing page can be found [here](SDGoals_UN/landing.html).


### Conclusions: Although overall, progress is being made to increase sustainability, progress is different for each country and each target due to differences in country regulations and standards.  Further analysis is needed for more comprehensive conclusions.  See project website for more thorough analysis.
